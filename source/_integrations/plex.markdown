The `plex` integration allows you to connect to a [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv). Once connected, [Plex Clients](https://www.plex.tv/apps-devices/) playing media from the connected Plex Media Server will show up as [Media Players](/integrations/media_player/) and report playback status via a [Sensor](/integrations/sensor/) in Home Assistant. The Media Players will allow you to control media playback and see the current playing item.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- [Media Player](#media-player)
- [Sensor](#sensor)

If your Plex server has been claimed by a Plex account via the [claim interface](https://plex.tv/claim), Home Assistant will require authentication to connect.

The preferred way to enable the Plex integration is via **Configuration** -> **Integrations**. You will be redirected to the [Plex](https://plex.tv) website to sign in with your Plex account. Once access is granted, Home Assistant will connect to the server linked to the associated account. If multiple Plex servers are available on the account, you will be prompted to complete the configuration by selecting the desired server on the Integrations page. Home Assistant will show as an authorized device on the [Plex Web](https://app.plex.tv/web/app) interface under **Settings** -> **Authorized Devices**.

<div class='note info'>

Local and secure connections are preferred when setting up an Integration. After the initial configuration, all connections to your Plex servers are made directly without connecting to Plex's services.

</div>

The `plex` integration can also be configured via `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
plex:
  token: MYSECRETTOKEN
```

<div class='note warning'>

Only one Plex server can be configured when using `configuration.yaml`. To add more servers, set up via **Configuration** -> **Integrations**.

</div>

## Media Player

The `plex` media_player platform will create Media Player entities for each connected client device. These entities will display media information, playback progress, and playback controls if supported by the device.

By default the Plex integration will create Media Player entities for all local, managed, and shared users on the Plex server. To choose specific users to monitor or ignore, select them via the Configuration Options (**Integrations** -> **Configured** --> **Plex** --> **Gear Icon**).

### Service `play_media`

Plays a song, album, artist, playlist, TV show/season/episode, movie, or video on a connected client.

Required fields within the `media_content_id` payloads are marked as such, others are optional.

### Notes

* The `plex` integration supports multiple Plex servers. Additional connections can be configured under Configuration > Integrations.
* When setting up a server via `configuration.yaml`, it is possible to get errors that look like the following.

  ```txt
  ERROR:plexapi:http://192.168.1.10:32400: ('Connection aborted.', BadStatusLine("''",))
  INFO:homeassistant.components.media_player.plex:No server found at: http://192.168.1.10:32400
  ```

  If this occurs, check the setting `Server`>`Network`>`Secure connections` on your Plex Media Server: if it is set to `Preferred` or `Required`, you may need to manually set the `ssl` and `verify_ssl` configuration options to, respectively, `true` and `false`.
* Movies must be located under 'Movies' section in the Plex library to properly get 'playing' state.

## Sensor

The `plex` sensor platform will monitor activity on a given [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/). It will create a sensor that shows the number of currently watching users as the state. If you click the sensor for more details, it will show you who is watching what.
