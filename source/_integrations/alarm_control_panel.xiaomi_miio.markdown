## Configuration

To set up the Xiaomi gateway, click Configuration in the sidebar, then click Integrations and then click the + icon in the lower right and find xiaomi_miio. Select the option "Connect to a Xiaomi Gateway" and click submit. You will then be presented with a form in which you will need to fill in the "IP address" and 32 characters "token".
